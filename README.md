# iOS Xcode Starter Project

An iOS Starter Project configured for unit/functional testing and analytics that we use to start our pjects at  [Two Bit Labs](http://twobitlabs.com)

### Features

* ARC enabled with Storyboards 
* Universal app to support both iPhone and iPad (but easy to disable
  one or the other)
* A sensible Xcode .gitignore file that works well for multi-person teams
* Libraries are includes as git submodules so you can pull in the latest versions
* [AnalyticsKit](https://github.com/twobitlabs/AnalyticsKit) to support optional integration of analytics providers like TestFlight, Flurry, Apsalar, Localytics, etc... Only the TestFlight SDK is included by default.
* Specta, Expecta, and OCMock to support TDD and BDD style iOS Development with Mock objects
* Example test/spec files to show you how to get started testing
* Seperate unit test and functional test target to separate out fast running tests from slow running tests
* MagicalRecord which makes working with Core Data enjoyable
* Development, Debug, and Release configurations (with support for multiple app id's) so you can install both the developemnt and release versions of the app on your devices side by side
* An NSURLCache configured with sensible memory defaults
* Code that triggers periodic memory warnings in the simulator so your app behaves more like it does on device
* A customized user agent string for UIWebViews
* An app delegate method to enable and disable the network activity indicator that counts the number of callers so it doesn't become disabled until the last caller disables it

### Getting Started

```bash
cd ~/src # the parent directory you want your new Xcode project created in
bash -e <(curl -Lo- http://bit.ly/ios-starter-project)
```

OR if you've cloned the iOSXcodeStarterProject github repo locally you can just run the script

```bash
cd ~/src # the parent directory you want your new Xcode project created in
/path/to/iOSXcodeStarterProject/migrate.sh
```


### TODO

* Document setting up the functional test scheme after the project is created
